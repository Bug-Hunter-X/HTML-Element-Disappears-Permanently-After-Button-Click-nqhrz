# HTML Element Disappears Permanently After Button Click

This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in HTML/JavaScript where an element is hidden using JavaScript but never restored to visibility.

The `bug.html` file shows the problematic code.  Clicking the button hides the div, and there's no way to make it reappear.

The `solution.html` file provides the corrected code.
